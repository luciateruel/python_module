# Hosts Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of different hosts/systems and their attributes, including hostnames, operating systems, and other information. The goal is to practice **Python functions, data manipulation, and visualization** using pandas and matplotlib.

---

## Features
- Defines Python functions to categorize hosts, for example:
  - `get_os(hostname)` determines the OS type based on hostname patterns (Linux, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX)
- Loads and cleans data using **pandas**
- Performs data analysis:
  - Counts of hosts per operating system
  - Identification of unknown or inconsistent entries
- Visualizes data using **matplotlib**:
  - Bar charts of hosts by OS
  - Other exploratory plots to understand distributions

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- pandas (data manipulation)
- matplotlib (data visualization)
