# Guess the Number Game

## Overview
This is a Python-based game called **"Guess the Number"** where players try to guess a randomly selected number. The game allows single-player or two-player mode, supports different difficulty levels, and keeps track of player statistics. This project was designed to practice Python fundamentals, functions, decorators, file handling, data analysis with pandas, and basic data visualization using matplotlib.

## Features
- Single-player and two-player modes
- Multiple difficulty levels for both the number range and number of tries
- Input validation to ensure correct and safe user inputs
- Tracks player statistics (victories, lost games) in an Excel file using **pandas**
- Displays visual statistics for each difficulty level using **matplotlib**
- Demonstrates practical use of functions, modular code, and decorators

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- pandas (for data storage and manipulation)
- matplotlib (for chart visualization)
- getpass (for secure two-player input)
- random (for generating random numbers)
- Excel file handling via **pandas**
